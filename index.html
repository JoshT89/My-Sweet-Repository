            <p class="intro">I am 33 years old and was not happy with my working life, it made me anxious and stressed turning my free weekends into recovery time rather than relaxation time.</p>

        <p> My journey started while working my 9-6 job monday to friday in medical recruitment.
            I have a friend who taught himself to code and is now able to travel the world while working and earning very good money.

    <p>My first step was reseraching who i should learn coding with, and Code Academy was reffered to by my friend I mentioned earlier.
        Code academy seemed a very good choice as it is recognised by some of the largest computer companies in the world and had many great reviews.
        I decided to jump stright in and paid for the pro course to become a Front End Egineer. 
        Handing in my notice was an incredible feeling already making me feel happier and a sense of freedom and excitment.
